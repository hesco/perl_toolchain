perl_toolchain

This is the perl_toolchain module.

An apt-dist upgrade gone bad led me to rebuild my home desktop
installation far more carefully than the wild-West snowflake
construction which passed for systems administration on its  
Lenny-versioned predecessor.  Primarily that has meant that 
all configuration and installations beyond the apt-select base desktop
install straight off the net-install CD have been puppetized for my
sanity and if this gets published, then for your enjoyment as well.

I wrote this for my own use without any mind for supporting 
its installation by others.  But for those who want to extend 
or adapt what I offer here, I urge you to consult the #puppet channel
on irc.freenode.net, and tool specific channels on irc.perl.net.
Sometimes I am on those channels and am able to answer questions.  
But there are also plenty of other folks on those channels many 
who know these tools better than I do.

Also helpful would be the puppetlabs.com website and the documentation 
provided for each individual application installed by this module 
accessible at search.cpan.org or one of its mirrors.  

However, if do-it-yourself systems administration is not your 
forte and you appreciate what I have assembled here and want 
me to extend it or to harden it to better work in your environment, 
I am avaialble to do contract projects to support this module, to 
help build or maintain your perl code base or to help automate 
your processes with an eye on providing for continuous delivery 
and deployment.  

I do business as CampaignFoundations.com and YMD Partners, LLC.  
Feel free to contact us if we can be of service.
